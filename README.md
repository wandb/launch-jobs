# Weights & Biases Launch Jobs

[W&B Launch](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch) introduces a connective layer between machine learning practitioners and the high-scale, specialized hardware that powers modern machine learning workflows. Easily scale training runs from your desktop to your GPUs, quickly spin up intensive model evaluation suites, and prepare models for production inference, all without the friction of complex infrastructure.

[A Launch Job](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch/create-job) is a complete blueprint of how to perform a step in your ML workflow, like training a model, running an evaluation, or deploying a model to an inference server.


In this repository, we have curated a set of popular jobs for common tasks.

## Deploy a model
